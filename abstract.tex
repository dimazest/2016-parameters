Previous optimisations of parameters affecting the word-context association measure used in distributional vector space models have focused on high-dimensional vectors; but low-dimensional versions are often required in compositional tasks. We present a systematic study of the interaction of these parameters and vector dimensionality, and derive parameter selection heuristics that achieve performance across different datasets competitive with the results previously reported in the literature.
